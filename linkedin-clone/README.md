This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), using the [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) and [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) template.

## To start the project

npx create-react-app linkedin-clone --template redux

## Firebase

- It will give the project a realtime backend
- It will allow us to host the service

## CloudFireStore - as a Database

- Create database

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

## Install these tools

npm install -g firebase-tools
npm install @material-ui/core
npm install @material-ui/icons

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

### authentication

Stored the user inside the Redux

### Structure

App.js is going to render both Feed.js(has multiple Post.js components within) and Login.js
So for that we need to pass the user object from login to upper hierarchy(i.e. to App.js)
and then to Feed.js which causes the problem of Prop Drilling.
*Prop Drilling* is the process by which you pass data from one part of the React Component tree to another by going through other parts that do not need the data but only help in passing it around.

*How we gonna solve it* : We are going to introduce REDUX which will make a data layer around all the 
components and we will push the user object in that layer and whichever component at any hierarchy
requires it, can consume it at any point.
-- The user information is going to store in UserSlice for this purpose
